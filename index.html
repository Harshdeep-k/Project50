    <p>We have crafted and amazing list of designs for your favorite animals. Origami is actually a very easy hobby to pick up and it’s a lot of fun. All you need is paper and you can use pretty much any paper you can find. This guide will show you the main folds, the basic bases that are used as the foundation for a huge number of different models and then you’ll learn how to fold your first model, the traditional paper crane.</p>

        <ol> 
            <li>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</li><br>
            <li> Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can’t eat.</li><br>
            <li>Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.</li><br>
            <li> Thanks to thick pads of skin on their chest and knees, camels can comfortably sit in very hot sand.</li>

        <ol>
            <li> Most lizards have fairly unremarkable feet. In the majority of species, they're comprised of four to five toes that can move independently of each other—just as ours do.</li><br>
            <li> They mainly change color in order to communicate or regulate body temperature</li><br>

    <h3> CICADA</h3>

    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.origami.me/cicada/"> <img src="images/cicada.png" width="200px" height="200px"> </a>
    <p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li><br>
            <li> They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.</li><br>
            <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</li><br>
            <li>They improve lawns by digging tunnels that allow air into the soil. When they die, their rotting bodies put nitrogen into the soil.</li><br>

    <h3> PANDA</h3>
    <hr>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.origami.me/panda/"> <img src="images/panda.png" width="200px" height="200px"> </a>
    <p> 
        <ol>
            <li>A giant panda is much bigger than your teddy bear.</li><br>
            <li>Pandas have so many fans because they look cute.</li><br>
            <li>As about all a panda does all day is eat and sleep, you are best to get up early for a visit to a panda park, so you see them when they are active.</li><br>
            <li>Pandas have carnivorous teeth, but they eat bamboo and fruit.</li><br>

    <h3 class="heading"> PIGEON</h3>
    <hr>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.origami.me/pigeon/"> <img src="images/pigeon.png" width="200px" height="200px"> </a>
    <p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition.</li><br>
            <li>Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.</li><br>
            <li>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</li><br>
            <li>Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time.</li><br>

    <hr>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.origami.me/teddy-bear/"> <img src="images/teddy.png" width="200px" height="200px"> </a>
    <p>
        <ol>
        <li> The origins of Hug A Bear Day are unclear but it may be connected with the day in November 1902 when Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear on a hunting trip in Mississippi.</li><br>
        <li> Winnie the Pooh was based on a real bear</li><br>
        <li> Jackie Miley, from Hilly City, South Dakota, has the world’s biggest teddy bear collection. As of 2012, she owned 8,026 cuddly bears.</li><br>
        <li> Magellan T. Bear became the first teddy bear in space when he boarded Space Shuttle Discovery in 1995. But he wasn’t just a bear on holiday—he was the “education specialist” on the mission, having been a project for a Colorado elementary school.</li><br>
